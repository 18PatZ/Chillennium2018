# Wolfing Around
#### Accidental Grocery Rampage

![alt_tag](https://github.com/18PatZ/Chillennium2018/blob/master/src/cutscene2.png)

In a grocery store,  you suddenly find  that there is a full moon out.  In the middle of a grocery store. Full of people.  You must control your urges to attack innocent people, and protect the grocers from enemy werewolves. 

Quickly, you grab the first object that you can find to throw at the wolves - apples

Use WASD to move around, T to shoot. Try the arrow keys for some trippy view changes.

The game was made with solely the JavaFX library during the 48-hour Chillennium game jam. The game engine that performs linear algebra matrix transformations from the game space to the screen pane, calculates collisions, creates drawing orders based on object depth, and displays the parallelogram image assets to render a cohesive 2.5D isometric view was made entirely by us from scratch.
